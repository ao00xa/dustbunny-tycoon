\section{Activity 2}

The second activity required the creation of a generic program capable of processing more that 16 million iterations.
Both index registers, X and Y, were used as decrementing counters. 
Since each is 16 bits, a loop capable of handling $2^{32}$ (approximately 4.3 billion) iterations was created.
The code shown below will iterate 6 times and perform a NOP on each iteration.
The program was simulated using CodeWarrior and was seen to behave as expected, performing a NOP six times before terminating.


\subsection{Code}

The number of iterations which will be performed is given by the values of X and Y multiplied before the program executes.
In this case, 2*3=6 iterations will be performed.
