\section{Activity 1}

The first activity required the creation of an assembly program which added the number three to accumulator A fifteen times before exiting.
The X index register was used as a counter.
After each addition, it was decremented and if it was not equal to zero, a loop to perform the desired action (adding 3 to register A) was repeated.

The program was simulated in CodeWarrior and was seen to behave as expected.
At termination, accumulator A had a value of 0x2D and register X a value of 0x0.
Partial code for this activity is shown below.
This was run within the template provided in the first lab.
