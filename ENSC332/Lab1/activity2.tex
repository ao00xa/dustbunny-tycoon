\section{Activity 2}

The second activity involved writing an assembly program which added five numbers and stored the result in register A.
The \emph{ADDA} instruction was used to sum a set of predefined values in-place in accumulator A.
The program terminated by entering an infinite loop.
Stepping through the program line by line using the debugger, the final value of accumulator A was verified.
