\section{Activity 1}

The first activity involved writing an assembly program which transfered a specific value to eight predefined memory locations.
The template given in the lab instructions was basis for creating the program.
A simplistic program was written which loaded the value to be copied to RAM into accumulator A.
It then used eight separate assembly instructions to write to each memory address.
After executing the eight store instructions, the program entered an infinite loop, effectively ending execution.
A potentially more efficient and elegant solution would used a counter use a single store command repeated eight times.
Regardless, the program performed as expected and using the debugging environment, the value of the RAM locations was seen to have the desired and expected value.
