\subsection{Files and Compilation}

The process of translating the assembly program into the binary image which is loaded onto the processor involves the creation of a number of different files.
These files, and the program responsible for their generation, are listed below.

\begin{description}

\item[.asm] - 
This file is the assembly program, written to perform a specific task.
%TODO: More
It is created by the programmer using the CodeWarrior IDE.

\item[.lst] -
The .lst file is generated by the assembler and lists any errors which were detected in the .asm file.
%	+ line numbers

\item[.obj] - 
The .obj file is also generated by the assembler. 
It contains the machine code.

\item[.s19] -
This file is generated by the linker from a given set of object files.
It is a hex file containing the data which is to be downloaded to the processor.
