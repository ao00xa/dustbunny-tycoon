\section{Ball Movement} 

Code related to ball movement is included in the \emph{main.c} file. 
There are a few important points which should be mentioned.
First, graphics functions are called int the init fucntion to create an image of a soccer ball.
Due to limitation of the OLED, the center pentagon had to be drawn as a set of five triangle.
Additionally, triangle vertices's must be drawn in a counter clockwise order.

Most core logic related to the ball is implemented in its move function.
Specifically, there is code used to detect when one player scores on another.
Randomization of the balls direction vector is also performed whenever it hits a players paddle.

%Init - drawing for soccer ball
%Move - wait to die
%move - randomization
%move -speed factor?
