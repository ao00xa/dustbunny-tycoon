\section{Serial Interface} 

Communication between the HCS12 micro-controller and OLED uses RS-232, a two wire, duplex, asynchronous serial communication protocol.
Of the two hardware communication blocks provided by the HCS12, SCI1 with external pins PS2 and PS3, was used to send and receive commands as described in section \ref{sec:graphics}.
Code used to interact with the relevant hardware registers may be seen in appendix \ref{code:interface.c}.
A list of pertinent registers is given in Table \ref{tbl:serialregisters}.

        Register Name & Function & Value \\
        \midrule 
        SCI1BDH & MSB baud rate selector & 0 \\
        SCI1BDL & LSB baud rate selector & 156 (For 9600 Buad) \\
        SCI1CR1 & Control Register & 0 \\
        SCI1CR2 & Control Register & 0x0C (enable transmit and receive circuits) \\
