\section{Player Paddles} 

Appendix \ref{code:paddle.h} and \ref{code:paddle.c} contains the code used for controlling and displaying player paddles.
The data for each paddle is encapsulated in a C structure.
Functions related to paddle control interact with these structures declared in \emph{main.c} (appendix \ref{code:main.c}).
Checks are performed in the \q{paddle\_move} function to ensure the player is unable to move their paddle off the screen in either direction.
