\chapter{Results and Conclusion} 

Despite the limiting OLED baud rate, PONG was successfully implemented on a screen external to the HCS12 and Dragon12 development board.
Functions written in assembly were created and found to be reliably callable from C code.
Serial control was found to be an effective means to send commands to an external device.
The Dragon12's LCD screen was also used in tandem with other display mechanisms.
