\section{Future Work}

Conducting experiment with actual system and observe its response. 
If the system appear to be large steady-state error then may be it requires adding integral gain. 
PI controller will improve the response and performance by reducing the steady-state error to zero. 
The reasons that cause the steady-state to increase are disturbance when the system is not level. 
In addition, steady-state errors are contributed to non-linear friction or dead zone. 
For instance, when an amplifier is used in a control system has the input signal which occurs within the dead zone, there will be zero the output of the amplifier, and the control would not be able to able to correct this error. 
Moreover, the output signals of digital components used in control systems take on only discrete or quantized levels. 
Therefore, the system generates an error in the output. 
It must be realized that there is no error-free control systems in the real world this because many physical systems have nonlinear characteristics;therefore, steady-state errors can be reduced but never completely eliminated.
