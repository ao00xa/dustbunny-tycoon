\section{Conclusion}

This report explains the method which was used to accurately determine the model and system parameters such as arm inertia. 
Secondly, it discusses the reasons for choosing PID and specifically PD based on specifications for maximum overshoot and settling time. 
Moreover, the report discusses the effects of $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$ on the overshoot and settling time values. 
Third, it illustrates the method which was used to verify system simulation and fine tune the controller parameters. 
Furthermore, the report describes the conversion of the PID output signal to motor voltage using the amplifier control. 
Finally, it concludes that all of the objectives of this project were successfully accomplished and future work ideas for improvements were proposed.
