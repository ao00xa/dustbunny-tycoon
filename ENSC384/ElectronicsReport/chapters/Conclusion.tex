\section{Conclusion}


In this part of the project, the bidirectional DC Motor Speed Controller Kit circuit was analyzed and built.
%
Based on the provided circuit diagram, component parameters for an oscillator with a 300 Hz frequency were selected for use in a pulse width modulation amplifier.
%
Using LTSpice, a simulation to verify calculations was performed.
%
The amplifier transfer function was found experimentally and from simulation data, illustrated by an average PWM output vs. input voltage graph..
%	TODO: Why so different
%	
Finally, an experimental estimate for the power dissipated by the circuits MOSFET transistors was found and used to determine no heat sink is needed.
