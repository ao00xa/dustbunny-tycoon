\section{Introduction}

The Bidirectional DC Motor Speed Controller Kit controls the speed of the DC motor in this project in both the forward and reverse direction. 
The direction and speed is controlled using a voltage input signal, initial set with a potentiometer. 
%The pot causes the motor to start spinning in one direction and when the pot turned in the other direction causes the motor to spin in the opposite direction. 
At a \q{center} input voltage, the motor is at rest.
For input voltages greater than this value, the voltage applied to the motor increases causing it to spin in one direction.
For input voltages less than this \q{center} input voltage, the motors direction is reversed.

The motor is controlled by a pulse width modulation (PWM) amplifier and driven by four MOSFET transistors in an H-bridge configuration.
This report first will briefly discuss the design of the oscillator for a nominal PWM frequency of 300Hz.
The results of a simulation performed in the LTSpice software package are then presented.
Secondly, the report will illustrate the input/output characterization of the circuit for a series of input voltages based on data gathered during simulation and testing. 
Furthermore, the power dissipated by the MOSFETs in the power amplifier will be estimated and the heat sink design will be selected. 
Finally, the verification and testing will be examined on both the physical circuit and the simulated design.
