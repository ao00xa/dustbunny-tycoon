\subsubsection{FEM and Indeterminate Structures}
%- Compare the finite element predicted outcomes with your indeterminate structure calculations and discuss the accuracy of each method (keep in mind the assumptions that go into both methods).

The finite element analysis was performed on structure 3, which differed from our values obtained by indeterminate analysis by a factor of 2. 
Accounting for this, our values are within 20\%, which is within an acceptable range.
