\subsubsection{Improving Efficiency}
%What else can you do to improve the efficiency of your truss structure?

By the definition of efficiency (stiffness/weight), the two ways to improve efficiency are either to increase the stiffness or reduce the weight.  We discovered that by increasing the height of the truss, to a maximum of 10 cm, we were able to increase the stiffness significantly for a variety of designs. On the other hand, by choosing designs with fewer members, we were able to reduce the overall length of brass rod used and minimize weight.
