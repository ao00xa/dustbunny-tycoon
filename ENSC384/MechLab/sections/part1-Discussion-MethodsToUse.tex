\subsubsection{Additional Methods}
%Discuss how you will use these different analysis methods to optimize your final truss design, are there other analysis methods or software that you will use? What are their advantages/disadvantages over the methods used here?

We plan to use 2-D finite element outcomes to tweak our design for optimization as well as indeterminate truss calculations to confirm our FEA results. 
In addition, since our final design will be in 3-D, we will consider using SolidWorks. 
The advantage to this method is that it allows us to visualize different possible 3-D structures and also apply rudimentary finite element analysis to the completed design.
