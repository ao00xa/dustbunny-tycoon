\subsubsection{Design Features}
%Using your two-dimensional finite element analysis of truss structure behaviours discuss the strengths and weakness of different truss designs and highlight design features that you think will be most effective for your design project. (Your project truss must span 30 cm â€“ from motor shaft to electromagnet center and carry the electromagnet (25 g) and mass (10g) with less than 0.05 mm deflection).

When doing the two-dimensional FEA of the test trusses, we determined that the last design, number 5, was the most efficient truss in terms of deflection and tolerance to buckling. 
We therefore used this truss as a starting point for our truss design. 
The features in design 5 that make for an effective design are maximizing the allowable height, balancing stiffness vs. weight, and ensuring individual truss members have similar safety factors (as is the case for design 5 - Table \ref{tbl:buckling}).
