\subsubsection{Other Factors}
%What other factors will contribute to your truss design? Identify other resources (not calculations) that could assist in your truss design optimization.

The main thing we need to consider is how to efficiently convert our 2-D truss into 3-D. We felt that an optimized vertical design would require a minimal number of properly placed members to support it horizontally during motion. Settling on the most efficient horizontal support will maximize our overall efficiency.
