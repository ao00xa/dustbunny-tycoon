\section{Finite Element Analysis}

This section of the lab examines several different truss designs using finite element analysis.
Sample 2D truss designs were evaluated using a provided MATLAB program in order to determine the axial forces and deflections in each member of the truss when various loads were applied. 
These sample designs, referenced by a design number throughout this report, are shown in figure \ref{fig:designs_given}.
The strengths and weaknesses of these truss designs are discussed. 
The load/deflection characteristics and the efficiency (stiffness/weight) of each structure is examined and used to compare each design.
Five additional designs are considered and compared to those provided on the basis of overall efficiency.
Finally, the results of an analytical solution, calculated using the method indeterminate structures, is presented and compared to the numerical approximations generated by the finite element analysis.

\subsection{Conclusion}

It appears the fifth design given proves the best efficiency and has a large factor of safety in all compressive members.
Additional examination of this design will be performed and a 3D model built to validate 2D calculations and assumptions.
More accurate constraints for mounting will also be considered.
Overall, the feature which was found to contribute most to structure efficiency was height.
