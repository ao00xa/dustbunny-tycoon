/* 
 * Comments are included throughout the generated code which allow you to
 * trace directly back to the approprate location in model.  The basic format
 * is <system>/block_name, where system is the system number (uniquely
 * assigned by Simulink) and block_name is the name of the block.
 *
 * Use the MATLAB hilite_system command to trace the generated code back
 * to the model.  For example,
 *
 * hilite_system('<S3>')    - opens system 3
 * hilite_system('<S3>/Kp') - opens and selects block Kp which resides in S3
 *
 * Here is the system hierarchy for this model
 *
 * <Root> : motor_spd_sf
 * <S1>   : motor_spd_sf/motor_spd_blk
