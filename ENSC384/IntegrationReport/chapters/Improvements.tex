\section{Limitations and Improvements}

Despite the controller itself having near optimal performance there are many ways to improve overall performance and increase its robustness and reliability.
These changes include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Use a power supply able to output more current such that it is the motor, not power supply which saturates.

\item The limited controller sampling rate was not fast enough for robust and effective software PWM. A dedicated microcontroller or digital PWM generation circuit should be used. 

\item \q{Slip} was observed, potentially caused by limited encoder or software PWM resolution. This could be corrected by using a more accurate encoder or positioning mechanism, such as laser sensors. 


\item The controller switching threshold is important and sensitive, having a large impact on  performance. 
In this project, thresholds were found manually and selected based on one of two movement modes ($45^\circ$ and $90^\circ$). 
This was sufficient; however, a more robust design would compute the threshold based on speed and position.  

\item Adding a physical damping could minimize physical vibrations.

\end{itemize}
