\section{Overview}

This report details controller design and system integration for the Mechatronics Design II project competition.
It describes the creation and tuning of a \q{switching} proportional, integral, derivative (PID) controller using Simulink.
Four major areas are covered.
First, basic support functionality required by the controller is discussed including the use of filters, software pulse width modulation (PWM) and voltage control (sections \ref{sec:filters} through \ref{sec:voltagecontrol}).
Second, a discussion of the optimal controller and the process of parameter tuning is presented in addition to the limitations of simulation for this particular controller (sections \ref{sec:idealcontroller} through \ref{sec:SimulationLimitations}).

Next, other key portions of the Simulink diagram are discussed in addition to the methods used for measuring system performance (sections \ref{sec:StabilityDetector} through \ref{sec:Timing}).
Finally, the final system performance is presented along with a discussion of potential improvements (sections \ref{sec:Performance} through \ref{sec:Conclusion}).
The complete Simulink block diagram may be found in appendix \ref{sec:fullsimulink}.
