\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

This report has discussed the basic features of the controller design such as filters, signal conditioning, software PWM, and voltage control. 
Furthermore, the report explained the approach taken to design the controller to maximize performance. 
Limitations to simulating this specific controller were discussed in addition to general system and controller limitations including proposed solutions to improve the response and increase the execution time. 
Finally the final system performance was presented, an overall time of 0.7432 seconds based on the common method used for measuring.
