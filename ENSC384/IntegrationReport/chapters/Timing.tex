\section{Timing}
\label{sec:Timing}

Two methods were used to measure system performance or drop time.
%In this project, there are two options were used to record the timing of the execution. 
First, the time between sending a manual trigger and the release of the puck by the electromagnet over the hole.
%the time is recorded when the trigger sent to until the magnet is released. 
Second, the time from which the arm starts moving until the limit switch is hit by the metal puck. 
Given correct truss positioning, where the puck was able to fall directly to the limit switch, the second method was seen to increase the measured performance time by approximately 50 msec. 
When an explicit offset was introduced, causing the puck to hit the edge of the hole, the discrepancy between the two measurements increased to 100-250 ms.
