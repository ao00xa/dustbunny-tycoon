\section{Final Performance}
\label{sec:Performance}

A graph showing overall system positioning performance may be seen in Figure \ref{fig:performance}.
The total time between triggering the system and releasing the puck over the hole was seen to be 0.7432 seconds (the first method from section \ref{sec:Timing}).
The total time between the arm starting to move and the puck hitting the limit switch was seen to be 0.7948 seconds (the second method from section \ref{sec:Timing}).
