\section{Competition and General System Configuration} 
\label{sec:competition}

The competition % describe more - probably unecessary
involves picking up a metal puck using a mechanical arm and electromagnet, moving it $90^\circ$, then dropping it in a hole. 
The mechanical arm starts at $0^\circ$, the puck at $45^\circ$ relative to the arm and the hole is positioned at $-45^\circ$.
Position graphs throughout this report show the arm moving from $0^\circ$, to $45^\circ$, then to $-45^\circ$ and finally returning to $0^\circ$.
The final step, although not required by the competition, was added for convenience. 
The y-axis for position graphs shows position in radians, not degrees.

A Sennsoray Model 626 data acquisition card was used to read encoder positions, read voltages using analog-to-digital converters, and control the circuit using digital-to-analog converters.
The Simulink controller time-step was set to $200 \mu s$, the maximum sampling and control rate supported by the hardware.
The motor was controlled using an H-bridge %First reference - might want additional explanation
motor controller circuit and powered with 9.5 Volts by a power-supply with a rated current capacity of 2.5 Amps.
