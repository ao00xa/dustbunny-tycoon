\section{Final Design and Drawing}

A diagram of the truss may be seen in figure \ref{fig:diagram}. 
Please note that member \emph{M1} was not part of the initial design and was not present during testing.
This oversight is discussed further in section \ref{sec:missingmember}.
Member \emph{M3} was deemed unnecessary due to the strength of the joints, qualitatively analyzed during construction.
It was neglected in an effort to save wight and improve efficiency.


%TODO: Additional discussion of design features.
