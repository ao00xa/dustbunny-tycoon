In this report, we discuss the design, analysis, and testing of the truss structure chosen for our project. 
The construction of the structure, objectives, design approach, and constraints, are all described. 
Quantitative analysis is presented for three truss structures using MATLAB finite element (FE) analysis leading to evaluation of the truss design alternatives. 
An analytical analysis of the optimal structure was completed using the Method of Joints and this was compared with the results from MATLAB FE analysis as well as the mechanical testing performed in class.
