\section{Introduction}

The objectives of the second project were to design an observer and state feedback controller for the linearized system from the first project.
Parameters for the state feedback were chosen in order to obtain appropriate values for settling time and overshoot.
State feedback was also used to stabilize the system as it would otherwise be unstable.
The observer monitors the system and estimates state variables.
The top magnet of the magnetic levitation apparatus was controlled; a system which is open-loop unstable.

The linearized model of the system is given in \ref{eq:finalLinearizedx}; it is unstable yet controllable.
A steady state location of 2 cm was chosen; all inputs and position measurements are assumed to be relative to this point.
Force exerted by the magnet is given by \ref{eq:Fmag}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:finalLinearizedx}
	{\bf \dot{x}} = 
	\left[
		\begin{array}{cc}
			 0 & 1 \\
			-6.32 & 0 \\
		\end{array}
	\right]
	%\left(
		{\bf x}
	%\right)
	+ 
	\left[
		\begin{array}{c}
			 0 \\
			 0.00537 \\
		\end{array}
	\right]
	%\left(
		u
	%\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:Fmag}
	F_{mag} = {\frac {u}{1.05 \left(x_1+6.2 \right) ^{4}}}
\end{equation}
