\section{Introduction}

The objectives of the second project were to design an observer and state feebback loop for the linearized system from the first project.
We want to choose the parameters for the state feedback in order to obtain appropriate values for settling time and overshoot.
State feedback is also useful for stabilizing a system that would otherwise be unstable.
The observer is supposed to monitor the actual system and estimate the state variables.
We implemented this on the top magnet, which uses attractive levitation (and is thus inherently unstable).

\subsection{System Model}

The linearized model that we started with is as follows.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:finalLinearizedx}
	{\bf \dot{x}} - {\bf \dot{x}^\star} = 
	\left[
		\begin{array}{cc}
			 0 & 1 \\
			 -{\frac {39.24}{z_0 + 6.2}} & 0 \\
		\end{array}
	\right]
	\left(
		{\bf x} - {\bf x^\star}
	\right)
	+ 
	\left[
		\begin{array}{c}
			 0 \\
			{\frac {9523.809524}{m\,\left( z_0 + 6.2 \right) ^{4}}} \\
		\end{array}
	\right]
	\left(
		u - u^\star
	\right)
\end{equation}


\subsection{Initial pole locations and stability}

Currently, the poles of the linearized system are as follows.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:poles}
	{\bf s} = 
	\left[
		\begin{array}{c}
			0 \\
			0 \\
		\end{array}
	\right]
\end{equation}
