\section{Results}

The system was implemented as described in the previous sections.
It was tested by applying a step function of 1.89 N, and recording the system response.
The resulting magnet position can be seen in figure \ref{fig:position} and its velocity in \ref{fig:velocity}.
Observer results are also presented in this graph.
