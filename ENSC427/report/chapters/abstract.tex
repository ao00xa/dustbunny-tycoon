\end{center}

Machine to machine communication has long been considered a feature of the next technological age. 
Networking options available today are either too expensive or cumbersome to justify the information they are able to provide (such as dedicated wired Ethernet or cellular data modems), or do not provide uniform connectivity (such as WiFi). 
An alternate solution is to use ad-hoc mesh networking. 
Such networks however, require every node to be connect to another and fail when the network is sparse or becomes partitioned.
Message ferrying is a routing scheme in which physical mobile devices, known as message ferries, are used as data transport mechanisms between disconnected network nodes or partitioned subnetworks.
This project will implement and simulate a message ferrying algorithm.
