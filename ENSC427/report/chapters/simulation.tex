\chapter{Simulation} 

Various scenarios are to be tested as discussed in section \ref{sec:scenarios}.

When simulating each scenario, the following metrics will be measured:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Time to update state in central repository (delay)
\item Variation in time to update state (delay jitter)
\item Number of state updates lost. Roughly corresponds to packet loss.
\item Memory utilization and packet dropping threshold within ferries.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scenarios}
\label{sec:scenarios}

\subsection{Scenario Considerations}

The following should be considered when designing scenarios
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of sources to ferries to gateways (various ratios)
\item Speed and trajectories of ferries (random vs set path)
\item Rate of source node state changes
\item Buffer size of ferries and size of property values (affects packet sizes)
\item Distances and distributions of ferries and gateways
\end{itemize}
