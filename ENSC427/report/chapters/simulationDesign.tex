\chapter{Simulation Design} 

Two stages

\begin{enumerate}
\item Simulate a basic, fully connected, ad-hoc network
\item Simulate a partitioned ad-hoc network implementing message ferrying
\end{enumerate}

Network topology: multiple clients and one server communication (duplex communication)

\section{Basic Ad-Hoc Network}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure application and configuration profiles are working
\item Obtain baseline statistics (delay, jitter and loss)
\end{itemize}

\section{Partitioned Network With Message Ferrying}

Also known as story-carry-forward

Design scenarios based on two parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Degree of partitioning (high and low) - how many partitions are there
\item Number of ferries (few and many)
\end{enumerate}
