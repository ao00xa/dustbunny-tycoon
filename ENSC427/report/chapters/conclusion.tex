\subsection{Fountain Codes}
\label{sec:fountain_codes}

An assumption of the scenario was that application messages can be transmitted in a single network packet.
A possible solution overcome this limitation without using an ARQ scheme (poorly suited to a delay tolerant network) is the use of fountain error correcting codes (aka rateless erasure codes).
